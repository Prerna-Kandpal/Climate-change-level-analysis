## 📖 Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on global climate change indicators to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in temperature, CO₂ emissions, renewable energy adoption, forest cover, rainfall, and extreme weather events.  
The goal is to provide **actionable insights for environmental policy and sustainability**.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Average Temperature  
  - CO₂ Emissions (Tons/Capita)  
  - Renewable Energy (%)  
  - Forest Area (%)  
  - Rainfall (mm)  
  - Sea Level Rise (mm)  
  - Extreme Weather Events  
  - Population

## ❓ Key Questions
- How have global temperatures changed over the years?  
- Which countries are the largest CO₂ emitters and how has that changed over time?  
- Which countries lead in renewable energy adoption?  
- How has forest area changed across countries?  
- How is sea level rise linked to temperature?  
- Are extreme weather events increasing?  
- Which regions are experiencing significant rainfall changes?  
- How do developed vs developing countries differ in emissions and energy use?  
- Are countries with higher forest coverage better at controlling emissions?

## 📊 Key Insights
- Global temperatures are **rising steadily**.  
- Top CO₂ emitters include **USA, China, Germany**; developing countries’ emissions are rising.  
- **Higher renewable energy adoption** correlates with slower CO₂ growth.  
- **Forest conservation** reduces emissions; some countries are losing forest cover.  
- Extreme weather events and rainfall changes are increasing.  
- Sea level rise is closely linked to temperature increases.

## 💡 Policy Recommendations
- Promote renewable energy in top CO₂-emitting countries.  
- Protect and expand forest cover in high-emission regions.  
- Develop coastal adaptation strategies for at-risk areas.  
- Strengthen disaster preparedness and early warning systems.  
- Implement sustainable water and agriculture management in affected regions.  
- Encourage energy efficiency policies in densely populated countries.  
- Support international collaboration for technology and funding.
